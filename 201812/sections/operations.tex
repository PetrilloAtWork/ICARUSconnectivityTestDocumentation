\section{Operative details}
\label{sec:operations}


The tests subject of this report happened in three distinct sessions:
\begin{description}
  \item[December 2018] the first extensive test including the \DBB and flanges
    took place. All mounted chimneys were eventually covered in three weeks,
    and the data from the test was recorded.
    This excludes \Chimney{WE02}, \Chimney{WE03}, \Chimney{WE04} and
    \Chimney{WW02}, which at that time were not physically available yet.
  \item[February 2019] another session was scheduled and took place in February
    2019, with the goal of performing the test in the final chimney
    configuration; it was split in two subsessions because for half of the
    chimneys optical flanges were going to be installed, and that installation
    could accidentally impact the connections of the other components in the
    chimney. All the chimneys were again tested, but the only recorded data
    was for the few chimneys that were missing it from December 2018.
  \item[March 2019] saw the last session take place, after an extensive
    intervention on all flanges to deposit glue on the clamps holding the
    68-wire cables.
