\begin{abstract}
  We present here the updated procedure and results of the connectivity tests done on the TPCs wire planes of the ICARUS detector on December 2018 and winter 2019.
  The test verified the connection of the TPC wires up to the connectors to the readout boards just outside the cryostats.
  All wires were tested on all three planes, with the exception of the shorter wires in the second induction and in collection planes, that are read out from the bottom flange of the eight chimneys at the end of the detector.
