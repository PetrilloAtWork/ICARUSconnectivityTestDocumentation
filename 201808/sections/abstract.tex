  We present here the procedure and results of the connectivity tests done on the TPCs wire planes of the ICARUS detector.
  All three, In\-duc\-tion-1, In\-duc\-tion-2 and Collection planes were tested.
  A test pulse was injected to each wire and an output signal was obtained and measured.
  An off-site analysis of the output signal waveforms was carried out for all standard and non-standard chimneys.
  As a result of the tests, we present a detailed description and mapping of how the detector is done from inside.
