\section{T600 Detector -- TPC (Time Projection Chamber)}
\label{sec:Detector}

detector done from inside.....


%To tests all the $53258$ wires that make up the whole ICARUS TPC without actually going inside the detectors it was decided to pull the connectors outside from the cryostat flanges through all the chimneys, to carefully and methodically inject a test pulse to the pulser cables that are directly connected to a board at the bottom of the vessel. To the same board is connected a single flat ribbon of 32-twisted cables connector that corresponds to only 32 wires of the TPC (Fig.). On top of the wire plane there's another board connected to another flat ribbon of those same 32 wires. This is the connector that then goes plugged-in to a test box.
